# Catnap

**Catnap** is an ADHD-friendly scheduling tool designed to help users manage their time and stay organized with ease. By allowing users to input tasks, block time, and receive push notifications, Catnap aims to foster productivity without overwhelming the user. We use this in a form of a cute companion Cat (currently with a placeholder) to whom you can manually text and schedule tasks (demure!)

## Features

- **Dialogue-Automated Scheduling**: An AI-powered c(h)atbot (using LLM models) which would convert your text input directly into calendar task blocks
- **Time Blocking**: Allow users to manually block out free and busy time slots for schedule recommendations
- **Decluttered Navigation**: A minimalistic interface that minimizes distractions and improves accessibility.
- **Push Notifications**: Receive reminders to stay on track and motivated throughout the day.

## Usage
